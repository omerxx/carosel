Carosel challange game 

The player is facing a rotating carousel which has 8 seats, 4 of them are vacant.
When a key is pressend the plaeyer jumps to the nearest seat.
If the seat is vacant the player gets in and starts rotating, else, he loses points.
The mission is to jump to the chair on the other end of the screen. Once completed, the game speeds up.

Uses a soon to be depricated pyGame, needs some update to run the UI.
